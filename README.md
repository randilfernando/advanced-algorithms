# Advanced Algorithms
## Assignment 1
In this question you are required to run Java code for different binary 
search trees, namely, basic BST, red-black tree and splay tree, and report the time 
taken to perform basic operations on them
## Assignment 2
Calculate performances of binary search and randomized binary search algorithms for a sorted array.
Search for 1000 elements where 700 of them members (success) and 300 of them non members (fails).
